## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use flexbox effectively, and when not to. Sometimes more boring CSS properties like position are actually the right solution to a specific problem.
I also learned a lot about background images and how to manipulate them. That was the most challenging part of this project for me.

### Continued development

I want to keep experimenting with flexbox, because I don't 100% confident working with it yet.
